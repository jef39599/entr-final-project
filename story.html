    <h1>Edward Hayden’s Entrepreneurial Journey</h1>

    <h2>Full Life Timeline</h2>
    <div class="timeline-container">

      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>🔬 Early Years & Education</h3>
        <p>Edward’s journey began with a passion for science. As a high schooler, he received a National Science Foundation scholarship to study college-level physics during the summer — this fueled his curiosity and confidence. He enrolled in the most challenging major he could: Physics. "What’s the hardest major you’ve got? I’ll take that."</p>
        <p>While pursuing his degree, he worked 35 hours a week, attending early morning classes and teaching assistant jobs. He developed strong time management, leadership, and a relentless drive to solve problems.</p>

      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>⚓ Military Career & Systems Thinking</h3>
        <p>After college, Hayden was recruited by IBM, but the Vietnam draft loomed. Instead, he joined the U.S. Navy where he worked on classified systems and simulation tools. He quickly noticed a pattern: "20% of people do 80% of the work." That experience shaped his belief in high-impact individuals and process-driven environments — laying the foundation for his future businesses.</p>

      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>💻 Entering the Tech World</h3>
        <p>Edward transitioned to the private sector, working at ComShare and AB Dick. There, he was exposed to early enterprise computing, customer modeling, and data systems. He began to innovate: redesigning CRM tools, integrating accounting platforms, and exploring the psychology of software design.</p>

      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>🚀 First Spark of Entrepreneurship</h3>
        <p>Edward never planned to be an entrepreneur. The opportunity found him. After leaving AB Dick, multiple clients called him directly: “We want to work with you, not the company.” Over a weekend, he rented office space, bought a desk, and hired a receptionist. On Monday, iConcepts was born. He built a corporation out of nothing — and made sure it looked like one too.</p>

      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>🏗️ Building His Ventures</h3>
        <p>After the success of iConcepts, Hayden saw gaps in the market. He created BOS Software to serve small-to-mid businesses with custom software. Later, he founded Southwestern Underwriters, combining his understanding of risk, systems, and client behavior.</p>
        <p>He didn’t just build companies — he built ecosystems. Each business answered a specific need, but they all connected through trust, technology, and long-term relationships.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>🧭 Leadership, Teaching, and Legacy</h3>
        <p>Edward became a mentor, a teacher, and a philosophical thinker on business. His leadership was guided by integrity, systems thinking, and the belief that results speak louder than marketing. He taught students the value of delivering on promises and the power of ethical decision-making.</p>
