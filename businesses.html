      <h2>🧠 iConcepts (1978)</h2>
      <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Founded over a weekend after Hayden left his job and clients called him directly. Rented an office, bought a desk, and hired a receptionist — all before Monday.</p>
      <p><strong>Services:</strong> Custom CRM platforms, salesforce automation, and client analytics software. Built to help businesses understand customer behavior and predict needs.</p>
      <p><strong>Impact:</strong> One of the first small businesses to implement predictive analytics and CRM personalization before it was a norm. Helped clients increase reorder rates by up to 60%.</p>
      <blockquote>"You have to look like somebody before they treat you like somebody."</blockquote>

      <h2>💼 BOS Software</h2>
      <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Born from conversations with AB Dick distributors who were using outdated systems. Hayden saw a gap and acted.</p>
      <p><strong>Services:</strong> Enterprise-level business operations software (ERP). Provided accounting, inventory, and sales processing in one ecosystem — adapted from international platforms, localized for U.S. businesses.</p>
      <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Hayden didn’t start from scratch. He reverse-engineered proven systems, restructured them for niche U.S. markets, and delivered clean, affordable software.</p>
      <blockquote>"Why build something new when you can optimize what already works?"</blockquote>

      <h2>🏢 Southwestern Underwriters</h2>
      <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Hayden recognized that many of his software clients lacked proper risk coverage and insurance guidance.</p>
      <p><strong>Services:</strong> Specialized insurance and underwriting services for small-to-mid sized tech-forward businesses. Focused on offering business continuity, data security, and liability coverage.</p>
      <p><strong>Integration:</strong> Combined software insights with insurance risk modeling — a rare hybrid approach. Provided underwriting services directly aligned with client data.</p>
      <blockquote>"Every business I built came from a gap the last one uncovered."</blockquote>
    </div>

    <div class="biz-card">
      <h2>🔄 Cross-Business Strategy</h2>
      <p>Hayden’s ventures weren’t silos — they were parts of a larger system. Software predicted client needs. Insurance protected those needs. All services were based on trust, efficiency, and simplicity.</p>
      <p>By connecting businesses horizontally, Hayden retained clients for decades — offering what most couldn't: seamless continuity, strong ethics, and long-term reliability.</p>
      <blockquote>"Three companies. One vision: make systems smarter, safer, and more human."</blockquote>
