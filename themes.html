    <div class="tab-content active" id="tab1">
      <h2>Operating Beyond Resources Controlled</h2>
      <p>Hayden bootstrapped his companies using only his own capital and relationships. He made sure his office and systems looked established before he had revenue. He said, “I didn’t want to look like a consultant — I wanted to look like a corporation.”</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tab-content" id="tab2">
      <h2>Building Systems Before Scaling</h2>
      <p>Even though his businesses weren’t product-based, Hayden focused on creating reliable systems in consulting, software, and insurance before expanding or hiring. This allowed for controlled growth and consistent delivery.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tab-content" id="tab3">
      <h2>Right Place, Right Time (Trust & Communication)</h2>
      <p>Hayden’s businesses grew from personal relationships and trust. Clients followed him from one company to another. He emphasized being direct, responsive, and reliable to keep trust intact.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tab-content" id="tab4">
      <h2>Leadership and Ethical Business Practices</h2>
      <p>He believed strongly in ethical leadership and creating trust with employees. Hayden noted that “ethics is everything when you have people working for you.” This influenced how he structured each venture.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tab-content" id="tab5">
      <h2>Nontraditional Backgrounds Can Prepare Founders</h2>
      <p>Hayden had no formal business education. Instead, he applied his training in physics, problem-solving, and government systems to business modeling and operations, giving him a unique edge in logic and efficiency.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tab-content" id="tab6">
      <h2>Founders’ Motivations Change Over Time</h2>
      <p>Initially, Hayden valued stability and job security. Over time, his motivations shifted toward control and the desire to build lasting structures. He stated that each business emerged from client demand rather than self-promotion.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tab-content" id="tab7">
      <h2>Control vs. Value Creation</h2>
      <p>Rather than accept external funding, Hayden retained ownership to preserve his values and autonomy. This meant growing slower but on his terms. He prioritized being accountable to clients, not investors.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tab-content" id="tab8">
      <h2>Necessity Drives Innovation</h2>
      <p>Each of Hayden’s companies was founded in direct response to a client problem. He didn’t invent ideas — he built solutions. From IRM to iConcepts, he let business form around demand, not theory.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tab-content" id="tab9">
      <h2>Education is Leverage</h2>
      <p>His academic training helped him design systems, understand technical work, and earn client trust. His work as a teaching assistant in physics and chemistry carried into how he mentored his teams.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tab-content" id="tab10">
      <h2>Personal Integrity as Strategy</h2>
      <p>Hayden didn’t promote himself through branding or ads. Instead, he focused on reputation. He said, “If I said it would take three months, it took three months.” Consistency and honesty were his brand.</p>
