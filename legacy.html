    <h1>Legacy & Ongoing Impact</h1>
    <p>"Entrepreneurship isn’t about having the best idea. It’s about solving the problem in front of you when it’s needed."</p>

    <h2>Mentorship & Education</h2>
    <p>Edward Hayden’s path was grounded in a love of learning. As a high school student, he participated in the National Science Foundation summer program for physics. In college, he chose physics as his major after asking what the hardest subject was. He worked 35 hours per week, waking up at 5:00 a.m. and taking evening classes to make it work.</p>
    <p>Hayden also worked as a teaching assistant in physics and chemistry. His belief in education carried forward into his businesses, where he trained employees, mentored new hires, and built systems to teach as they scaled.</p>

    <h2>Founding Team Dynamics</h2>
    <p>Edward Hayden operated with a strong preference for autonomy throughout his entrepreneurial journey. He did not seek out co-founders or investors, opting instead to maintain full control of his ventures. This allowed him to ensure that ethical standards, strategic decisions, and operational systems aligned with his values. While he worked closely with contractors and employees as his companies grew, there is no indication of significant role misalignment or conflict. His leadership style emphasized clarity, structure, and self-reliance, which minimized the risk of team dysfunction and allowed for consistent execution from one venture to the next.</p>

    <h2>Business with Integrity</h2>
    <p>One of the strongest themes from Hayden’s interview was the role of ethics in leadership. He shared that he would rather maintain his standards and walk away than compromise integrity for growth. He chose not to take on partners or external funding in order to retain control over decisions and values.</p>
    <p>He emphasized that how you treat people defines your business: “Ethics is everything when you have people working for you.”</p>

    <h2>Long-Term Thinking</h2>
    <p>Hayden’s legacy is also one of systems and sustainability. He didn’t just create companies — he created long-term structures that could operate reliably. He used his physics and systems background to design processes that worked even when he wasn’t there.</p>
    <p>This mindset influenced how he structured iConcepts, BOS Software, and Southwestern Underwriters. Each company served a real market need and was designed to evolve with its clients.</p>
